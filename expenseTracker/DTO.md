## DTOs vs Direct Entity Mapping in Spring Boot

### 1\. Problem with Direct Entity Mapping

When you use a direct entity (like `Expense`) as the `@RequestBody` in a Spring Boot controller, Spring expects the incoming JSON to match the entity structure exactly. This can cause issues if:

- The JSON does not match the entity fields (e\.g\., nested objects vs\. IDs\).
- The entity has relationships (like `Category`) that are hard to represent in a simple request.
- You want to decouple your API from your database model for flexibility and security.

#### **Example Request Without DTO**

```json
{
    "title": "Groceries",
    "amount": 400,
    "date": "2024-07-01",
    "category": {
        "id": 1
    }
}
```
*Requires the client to know the entity structure and send nested objects, tightly coupling your API to your database model.*

### 2\. Why and When to Use a DTO

**Why use a DTO?**
- Define exactly what data you expect from the client.
- Use simple fields (like `categoryId`) instead of nested objects.
- Easier validation, error handling, and mapping.
- Keeps your entity model separate from your API contract.

**When to use a DTO?**
- When your entity has relationships or fields not easily represented in JSON.
- When you want to control what data is exposed or accepted by your API.
- For better maintainability and clarity.

### 3\. How to Use a DTO

#### **Example DTO Class**

```java
public class ExpenseDTO {
    private String title;
    private double amount;
    private String date;
    private int categoryId;
    // getters and setters
}
```

#### **Example Request With DTO**

```json
{
    "title": "Groceries",
    "amount": 400,
    "date": "2024-07-01",
    "categoryId": 1
}
```
*Simpler for clients to use; only simple values are required.*

#### **Mapping DTO to Entity in Service Layer**

```java
public Expense createExpense(ExpenseDTO expenseDTO) {
    Category category = categoryRepository.findById(expenseDTO.getCategoryId()).orElse(null);
    Expense expense = new Expense();
    expense.setTitle(expenseDTO.getTitle());
    expense.setAmount(expenseDTO.getAmount());
    expense.setDate(expenseDTO.getDate());
    expense.setCategory(category);
    return expenseRepository.save(expense);
}
```

### 4\. Summary

- Use DTOs to simplify request payloads and decouple your API from your entity model.
- DTOs make handling relationships and validation easier.
- Avoid using entities directly as `@RequestBody` when they have complex relationships or when you want to control your API contract.
