# Expense Tracker App: Essential & Advanced Improvements

## Next Steps & Advanced Improvements

- **Redis Caching (Backend):**
  - Integrate Redis with Spring Boot (`spring-boot-starter-data-redis`).
  - Cache frequently accessed data (categories, analytics).
  - Invalidate cache on updates for data consistency.

- **Dockerized Database:**
  - Use Docker and PostgreSQL for a portable, production-like environment.
  - Provide a `docker-compose.yml` for easy setup.
  - Configure Spring Boot to connect to the Dockerized database.

- **Budget Implementation:**
  - Add budget fields to category/expense models.
  - Create endpoints for setting and retrieving budgets.
  - Track and compare expenses against budgets.
  - Show budget utilization and historical trends.

- **Advanced Analytics:**
  - Allow users to select month/year for analytics.
  - Validate analytics parameters before querying.
  - Use charts and visualizations for budget distribution and utilization.
  - Support lazy loading or pagination for large datasets.

- **Caching (Frontend):**
  - Cache categories and static data in local state or localStorage.
  - Invalidate cache on add/edit/delete.

- **Personalization & UX:**
  - Allow users to set preferred currency, theme (dark/light), dashboard layout.
  - Enable inline editing of expenses in list/table view.
  - Add advanced filters and search (by category, date range, amount).
  - Ensure responsive design and accessibility.

- **Security:**
  - Restrict access to analytics endpoints to valid parameters only.

- **Testing & Documentation:**
  - Write unit and integration tests for new features and advanced logic.
  - Document code, architecture decisions, and setup instructions for new features.
